## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r data_read}
lobsters <- read_xlsx(here("data/lobsters2.xlsx"), skip=4)

head(lobsters)
summary(lobsters)

skimr::skim(lobsters)


```

```{r}
lobsters %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(count_by_year = n())
```

```{r}
lobsters %>%
  group_by(site, year) %>%
  summarize(count_by_siteyear =  n())  %>%
  print(n = 50)
```

```{r}
siteyear_summary <- lobsters %>%
  group_by(site, year) %>%
  summarize(count_by_siteyear =  n(), 
            mean_size_mm = mean(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE), 
            sd_size_mm = sd(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE))

siteyear_summary
```
```{r}
siteyear_summary %>%
  kable()
```

```{r}
siteyear_summary <- lobsters %>%
  group_by(site, year) %>%
  summarize(count_by_siteyear =  n(), 
            mean_size_mm = mean(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE), 
            sd_size_mm = sd(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE), 
            median_size_mm = median(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE))

ggplot(data = siteyear_summary, 
       aes(x = year, 
           y = median_size_mm, 
           color = site)) +
  geom_line() 
```
```{r}
ggsave(here("figures", "lobsters-line.png"))
```

```{r}
ggplot(siteyear_summary, aes(x = year, y = median_size_mm)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~site)
```

```{r}
ggsave(here("figures", "lobsters-col.png"))
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
